        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">Albert Camus</a>
        was a <strong>French-Algerian philosopher</strong>, author, and
        journalist, born in 1913. He is known for his contributions to the
        philosophy of absurdism, a school of thought that explores the conflict
        between human tendencies to seek inherent value and meaning in life and
        the inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and
        irrational universe. Camus' most famous works include the novel
        <em>"The Stranger" ("L'Ã‰tranger")</em> and the essay "The Myth of
        Sisyphus," both of which explore themes of existentialism, absurdity,
        and the human condition. Despite being closely associated with
        existentialism, Camus himself rejected this label. His writing style
        combined profound philosophical thoughts with a simple and
        straightforward prose, which made his work accessible and influential.
        In addition to his philosophical writings, Camus was also known for his
        stance against totalitarianism and his advocacy for individual freedom,
        which was reflected in both his written work and his actions during his
        lifetime. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957. Other
        accolades of his include:
